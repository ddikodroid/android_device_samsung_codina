Those are device configuration files for Galaxy Ace II.

Warning!

If you wish to use this, make sure you have PHP installed on your system.
At least **PHP 5.1**.

On Debian based distributions (such us Ubuntu), you can install it with this:

***apt-get install php5 php5-cli***

Why? Because it will be needed in order to set-up vendor blobs...
But why **PHP**?! Because I said so.
